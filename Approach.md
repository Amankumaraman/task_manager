# Approach for Task Management 

## Project Setup

1. **Project Initialization:**
   - Started by setting up a new Django project and app specifically for the Task Management API.
   - Installed necessary packages such as Django, Django REST Framework, and JWT for authentication.

2. **Database Design:**
   - Designed the database schema using Django models, including User and Task models.
   - Implemented relationships to allow task assignments to users.

## API Implementation

3. **User Registration and Authentication:**
   - Implemented user registration using Django’s built-in User model, ensuring passwords are securely hashed.
   - Developed a login endpoint that returns a JWT token for authenticated requests.

4. **Task Management:**
   - Created endpoints for CRUD operations on tasks, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete their tasks.
   - Implemented task assignment by linking tasks to specific users through foreign key relationships.

5. **Filtering and Searching:**
   - Added filtering capabilities to allow users to filter tasks based on status, priority, and due date.
   - Implemented search functionality to enable users to search tasks by title or description.

## Dockerization

6. **Containerization:**
   - Created a Dockerfile to define the application’s environment and dependencies.
   - Configured a `docker-compose.yml` file to manage multi-container applications, including PostgreSQL as the database service.

## API Documentation

7. **Swagger Integration:**
   - Integrated Swagger for automatic API documentation, allowing users to explore and test the API endpoints easily.

## Conclusion

This Task Management API provides a comprehensive solution for managing tasks effectively. The implementation leverages modern practices in web development, ensuring a robust and maintainable codebase.

### Assumptions Made
- Users will only have one role (default: User) for this implementation.
- The API is designed with the assumption that the user will not exceed a certain number of tasks, which may require pagination for larger datasets in future iterations.
